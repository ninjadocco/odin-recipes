    <h1>Spaghetti Bolognese</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mom's spaghetti Bolognese recipe was passed on from my Italian grandfather. 
    The ultimate comfort food. Leftovers freeze nicely! 
    To make this recipe more authentic, you can use a mixture of ground veal, 
    pork, and beef. 
    You can also substitute 1/2 cup of red wine for the balsamic vinegar.</p>

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>
    <ol>
    <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. 
    Stir in spaghetti and return to a boil. Cook spaghetti uncovered, 
    stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 
    about 12 minutes; drain.</li>

    <li>Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; add bacon. 
    Cook, turning occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. 
    Add onion, celery, carrot, and oregano to bacon; 
    continue cooking until vegetables begin to soften, 8 to 10 minutes. 
    Add garlic; cook until fragrant, about 2 minutes. 
    Crumble in ground beef; cook and stir until no longer pink and completely cooked, 
    8 to 10 minutes.</li>

    <li>Pour vinegar over ground beef mixture; simmer until liquid evaporates, 
    about 5 minutes. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and sugar; 
    bring to a boil, season with salt and black pepper, then remove from heat. 
    Stir in basil.</li>

    <li>Spoon sauce over spaghetti; top with Parmesan cheese to serve.</li>
